# Student Performance Analysis

## Project Description
This project involves an analysis of student performance based on various factors. Various data analysis techniques such as descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, grouped analysis, hypothesis testing, regression analysis, classification analysis, and clustering analysis are used.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was obtained from Kaggle. It contains information about student performance and various factors that might influence it, such as parental level of education, lunch type, and whether the student completed the test preparation course.

## Requirements
This project requires Python and the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Run the Project
1. Install the necessary libraries: `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter`

2. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/student-performance.git`

3. Navigate to the cloned repository: `cd student-performance`

4. Start Jupyter notebook: `jupyter notebook`

5. Open the `.ipynb` file in the Jupyter Notebook to view the project.

## Results
The analysis revealed several interesting insights about student performance. For example, 
I have analysed that the number of females are more than the number of male in the data.
I have concluded that the education of parents have a good impact on the scores of thrie childrens.
I have analysed that the Marital Status of the parents have a very negligible impact on their children.
I have gained an insight of the distribuation of Ethenic groups and the number of students from different Ethenic Group.
Students who have standard lunch type tend to have higher math scores than those who have free/reduced lunch type. The regression analysis showed that the lunch type, weekly study hours, and whether the student is the first child in their family are significant predictors of math score. The classification analysis predicted the grade of a student based on other variables with an accuracy of approximately 33.9%. The clustering analysis grouped students into clusters based on their characteristics and scores, which could help identify groups of students with similar performance and characteristics.
